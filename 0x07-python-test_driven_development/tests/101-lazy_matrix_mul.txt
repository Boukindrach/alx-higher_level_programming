Documentation for lazy_matrix_mul Function
===========================================

Defines a matrix multiplication function using NumPy.

Usage
-----

This function performs matrix multiplication using NumPy. Matrix multiplication
is a fundamental operation in linear algebra used to combine the elements of two
matrices to produce a third matrix.

    lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)

Parameters
----------

- `m_a` (list of lists of ints/floats): The first matrix to be multiplied.
- `m_b` (list of lists of ints/floats): The second matrix to be multiplied.

Returns
-------

- ndarray: The resulting matrix obtained by multiplying `m_a` and `m_b`.

Example
-------

Consider the following input matrices:

```python
>>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
>>> m_b = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
